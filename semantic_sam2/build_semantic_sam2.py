    Build a Semantic SAM2 model with optional safe checkpoint loading.
    
    This is a wrapper around sam2.build_sam.build_sam2 that adds the ability
    to use a custom checkpoint loader that handles architecture mismatches
    (e.g., different numbers of mask tokens/classes).
    
    Args:
        config_file: Path to config file (e.g., "sam2.1_hiera_l_semantic")
        ckpt_path: Path to checkpoint file (can be standard SAM2 checkpoint)
        device: Device to load model on ("cuda" or "cpu")
        mode: Model mode - "eval" or "train"
        hydra_overrides_extra: Optional list of Hydra config overrides
        apply_postprocessing: Whether to apply dynamic multimask postprocessing
        use_load_checkpoint_staged_safe: Whether to use safe checkpoint loading.
            Set to True when:
            - Loading a standard SAM2 checkpoint into a semantic model with
              different number of classes
            - The checkpoint has different architecture (e.g., 4 mask tokens
              but your model has 9 class tokens)
            Set to False when:
            - Loading a semantic checkpoint that matches your model architecture
            - Loading a previously saved checkpoint from training
        **kwargs: Additional arguments passed to build_sam2
    
    Returns:
        Loaded SAM2Semantic model
